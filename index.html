            <p class="bio">After spending a few years tinkering with beginner classes on programming languages, the way I looked at everyday tasks changed. I started to see monotonous tasks as problems that can be solved with programming. I found myself concocting plans to tackle these problems but they always seemed to fall flat when it came to actually writing code that worked. </p><br>

            <p class="bio">I finally got to a place where I needed to make a change. I either needed to take a much more strict and regimented approach to learning these languages or I needed to let go of the idea of becoming a programmer all together. I did some research and decided to join a bootcamp with the goal of gaining more skill and building a network that is centered around programming.</p>
